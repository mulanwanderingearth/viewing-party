## Accessibility Needs

Reliable communication channels.

A working local development environment.

Access to shared documentation and resources.

Flexibility and support for different schedules and learning paces.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will work individually and come together during the co working session to share the progress. We will be using huddle, zoom to communicate our doubts/progress after coding each section.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

We learn best through open discussion with teammates and by asking questions to receive constructive feedback.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

We prefer feedback that is clear, constructive, and timely, with specific suggestions we can use to improve. We will try to include examples or suggestions we can act on, not just what went wrong.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

We want to work on managing our time better so we can give updates more consistently. We also want to improve how we explain our solution to our teammate.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
We will aim to meet and collaborate at times when both of us are available, likely in the evenings after 8 PM. We will work on each wave at night and discuss about the progress and changes during coworking time in the afternoon.
